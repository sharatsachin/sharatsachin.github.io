<h1>üë®‚Äçüíº Experience</h1>

<h3>Nagarro - Senior Engineer (Data Scientist)</h3>
<h4 align="right">October 2020‚ÄìPresent</h3>

- **Inventory Management Using Reinforcement Learning:** Developed a system utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as Q-learning or Deep Q-learning, to optimize inventory levels. Implemented algorithms to learn optimal stocking levels based on demand patterns and cost considerations, resulting in significant cost savings for the business.
- **Product Return Forecasting:** Utilized statistical modeling techniques, such as time series analysis or machine learning, to analyze historical data and identify patterns related to product returns. Developed models to predict future return rates, enabling the business to better manage inventory and plan resources efficiently.
- **Multi Touch Attribution Using Markov and Shapely:** Developed a model to attribute sales to different marketing channels using Markov chains and Shapely values. The model helped the business understand the impact of each marketing channel on sales and optimize marketing strategies accordingly.
- **Budget Reallocation Using Linear Programming:** Worked on optimizing budget allocation across various campaigns and ad groups using linear programming techniques. Analyzed campaign performance data and market trends to determine the most effective allocation strategy, resulting in improved performance and resource utilization.
- **Scheduling Accelerator Using Ant Colony Optimization:** Designed and implemented an internal demo to optimize the workflow of a manufacturing process. Utilized Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to schedule various jobs on different machines, improving production efficiency and reducing idle time.
- Demand forecasting for a leading cosmetics company - Delivered an end-to-end demand forecasting solution accurately predicting demand for thousands of products across multiple online marketplaces. Utilized gradient boosting models and time-series models like Prophet / Sarimax to build a weighted forecast at product level.
